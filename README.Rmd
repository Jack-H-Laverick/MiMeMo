MiMeMo.tools is an R package for data extraction and the parameterisation of the end to end ecosystem model StrathE2Epolar. MiMeMo will use StrathE2Epolar in the Barents Sea and East Greenland Shelf. The functions contained in this package streamline the process of sampling along the boundary, and within the volumes, of StrathE2E model compartments.

## Installation

As these tools are highly specific, there is no intention to relase the package to the [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org).
The internal facing / development version can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("Jack-H-Laverick/MiMeMo.tools")
```
<br/>
Installation will fail if Robert Wilson's `rcdo` package is unavailable. This is used to extract vertical water exchanges. This package might not be available to Windows users.
