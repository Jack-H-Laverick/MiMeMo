MiMeMo.tools is an R package for data extraction and the parameterisation of the end to end ecosystem model StrathE2Epolar. MiMeMo will use StrathE2Epolar in the Barents Sea and East Greenland Shelf, but these functions have continued to be useful for other implementations of strathE2E2 under Mission Atlantic. The functions contained in this package streamline the process of sampling along the boundary, and within the volumes, of StrathE2E model compartments. It is supported by the nemomedusR and slabR packages.

## Installation

The package can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("Jack-H-Laverick/MiMeMo.tools")
```
<!-- <br/> -->

<!-- div.red { background-color:#fec0c0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 10px;} -->
<!-- </style> -->
<!-- <div class = "red"> -->

<!-- ❗ Installation will fail if Robert Wilson's `rcdo` package is unavailable. This might be true for Windows users. </div> -->
