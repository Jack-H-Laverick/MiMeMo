MiMeMo.tools is an R package for data extraction and the
parameterisation of the end to end ecosystem model StrathE2Epolar.
MiMeMo will use StrathE2Epolar in the Barents Sea and East Greenland
Shelf, but these functions have continued to be useful for other
implementations of strathE2E2 under Mission Atlantic. The functions
contained in this package streamline the process of sampling along the
boundary, and within the volumes, of StrathE2E model compartments. It is
supported by the nemomedusR and slabR packages.

## Installation

The package can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("Jack-H-Laverick/MiMeMo.tools")
```
